# OpenUPM Bridge Repository

This repository serves as a bridge for publishing Unity packages to [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/).

The main goal of this repository is to host release tags for multiple Unity packages in a structure that OpenUPM can ingest. It acts as a centralized publishing point where packages from other sources (like GitHub Releases) can be "re-packaged" into a format suitable for UPM.
